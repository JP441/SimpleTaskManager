## üòÑ Why I made this app <a name = "about"></a>
I made this app because I wanted to develop my Python skills, particularly in UI development, and this is my first project in that domain. Additionally, I was looking for a simple way to keep track of my daily tasks and assist my university friends in managing their assignments. I envisioned an app that could list tasks and provide alerts when a task is approaching its due date. While there are task apps available, like Notion, they often require extensive setup and are more complex than necessary for my needs. Therefore, I aimed to create a simple and efficient solution, which led to the development of this app.
